# Auto_using_bash
This project focuses on creating a Bash script that automates essential system maintenance tasks such as backup, old file cleanup, and notification sending. The goal is to help users automate repetitive or critical operations on their system, making it easier to manage backups, free up disk space, and ensure that any issues are reported promptly.
